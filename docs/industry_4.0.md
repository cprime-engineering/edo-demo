# The Fourth Industrial Revolution

Industry 4.0 is a revolution in manufacturing that is taking place right now. Industry 4.0 has been expressed widely in scientific literature, and Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum Founder and Executive Chairman popularized the term in 2015.

Recent global events have accelerated that revolution in ways that would have been hard to predict as recently as three years ago. The Global Covid Pandemic has resulted in a worldwide semiconductor shortage crippling technology supply chains. The Russian-Ukrainian war has also bought into question globalized supply chain dependencies. These events have led industries and nations to rethink their supply chain logistics and energy security. Industry 4.0 can provide some attractive solutions to these challenges.

In the field of Industry 4.0, manufacturers are integrating new technologies throughout their manufacturing operations and logistical supply chains. Including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Analytics.

Manufacturers are building smart factories and warehouse facilities with advanced sensors and embedded software systems. Robotics is evolving rapidly with ever-increasing intelligence and decision-making on the production line powered by advances in artificial intelligence. Virtual and Augmented Reality is transforming how employees train and interact with the industrial environment.

Advanced engineering technologies such as 3D printing, renewable energy, and the use of nanoparticles to develop new materials may result in the most significant evolutions in how we approach manufacturing. What to many may sound like science fiction is today being implemented in the real world by forward-thinking, technically advanced companies that are winning the race to own the future of global manufacturing.

The winners in this race are extending their lead. One can predict a tipping point where those corporations that have ignored this revolution and failed to invest in new technology find themselves with no means to recoup, uncompetitive and redundant.

A truly inspiring project that demonstrates these principles in practice is the EQXX 1000 KM challenge from Mercedes Benz. Rapid R&D applying the technologies described here resulted in a remarkable example of automotive engineering. Software in the Loop, Additive Manufacturing, AI, Advanced Materials Science, and a new manufacturing technique, Bionicast, developed within Mercedes during this project. The EQXX is not a pure R&D project; this automobile is designed from the ground up for manufacture with Industry 4.0 technology.

Did they do it? Find out [here](https://youtu.be/hCcbz8B64yk). Spoiler alert, the EQXX is available in late 2023 for ~$140,000 on the road.

The following video is an insight into the rate of change and optimization in supply chain logisticsâ€”an insight into Amazon's smart warehouses. The video shows how much of a competitive edge AI and Robotics can provide but also discusses the challenges of integrating these technologies with a human workforce and the impact on workers' rights.

The domains of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) are merging. The internet is evolving into an interconnected environment of people, places, and things. So too, in manufacturing and logistics, an ecology of connected and autonomous manufacturing equipment and systems is developing. Made possible by augmenting OT domains with IT technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing.

Protocols are becoming established for interconnectivity and communication. Such as MQTT, an OASIS standard messaging protocol for IoT. MQTT today is used in various industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil, and gas.
