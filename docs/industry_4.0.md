# The Fourth Industrial Revolution

Industry 4.0 is a revolution in manufacturing that is taking place right now. Industry 4.0 has been expressed widely in scientific literature, and Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum Founder and Executive Chairman popularized the term in 2015.

Recent global events have accelerated that revolution in ways that would have been hard to predict as recently as three years ago.

Industry 4.0 can provide some attractive solutions to these challenges.
