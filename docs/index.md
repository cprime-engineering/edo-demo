## Embedded DevSecOps Demo

This repository contains examples of how engineering teams can apply cloud-native DevSecOps practices when developing embedded systems software.

Over the last twenty years, cloud computing has revolutionized how engineers approach software development. Cloud computing changed many paradigms and turned technical constraints upside down. Infrastructure became disposable, computing power available on demand and billable by the second. Software dependencies are now distributed ecosystems at a global scale.

In the last five years, prevailing engineering practices have matured to work cohesively within these new programming paradigms. Cloud-native development practices have crossed the chasm: they are the new normal, the state of the art.

Any engineering team not practicing continuous delivery and automated code quality validation can now be considered Luddite. Artificial Intelligence plays a front-stage role in software development, code quality, and security demand AI's involvement. Contemporary software quality is now beyond human capacity.

Code quality automation provides a positive side-effect: a significant increase in delivery speed and innovation rate. Releasing software on-demand, multiple times per day, into production environments is possible. For companies born in this era, it is their normality, the true cloud-natives.

Embedded systems software is an industry sector left behind throughout this revolution, an accident of circumstance and operational context.

While cloud computing has evolved at an ever-increasing rate of innovation, the mainstream embedded systems development community has yet to adopt the new engineering disciplines associated with cloud computing. This lack of adoption should not surprise; the embedded systems development communities' thinking has remained firmly inside the box. That is their domain; that is where they develop software.

There is another significant factor for this lack of adoption of cloud-native development practices. Let's consider software languages and frameworks to be a spectrum. Those languages and frameworks used when developing software for the cloud, and those used in embedded systems development are at opposite ends of that spectrum. The Python language is the one notable exception to this rule. Learning new and alien skills for engineers from either end of this spectrum is challenging and time-consuming. Still, it is precisely this that is required to modernize the embedded systems software development lifecycle.
