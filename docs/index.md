## Embedded DevSecOps Demo

This repository contains examples of how engineering teams can apply cloud-native DevSecOps practices when developing embedded systems software.

Over the last twenty years, cloud computing has revolutionized how engineers approach software development. Cloud computing changed many paradigms and turned technical constraints upside down. Infrastructure became disposable, computing power available on demand and billable by the second. Software dependencies are now distributed ecosystems at a global scale.

In the last five years, prevailing engineering practices have matured to work cohesively within these new programming paradigms. Cloud-native development practices have crossed the chasm: they are the new normal, the state of the art.

Any engineering team not practicing continuous delivery and automated code quality validation can now be considered Luddite. Artificial Intelligence plays a front-stage role in software development, code quality, and security demand AI's involvement. Contemporary software quality is now beyond human capacity.

Code quality automation provides a positive side-effect: a significant increase in delivery speed and innovation rate. Releasing software on-demand, multiple times per day, into production environments is possible. For companies born in this era, it is their normality, the true cloud-natives.

Embedded systems software is an industry sector left behind throughout this revolution, an accident of circumstance and operational context.

While cloud computing has evolved at an ever-increasing rate of innovation, the mainstream embedded systems development community has yet to adopt the new engineering disciplines associated with cloud computing. This lack of adoption should not surprise; the embedded systems development communities' thinking has remained firmly inside the box. That is their domain; that is where they develop software.

There is another significant factor for this lack of adoption of cloud-native development practices. Let's consider software languages and frameworks to be a spectrum. Those languages and frameworks used when developing software for the cloud, and those used in embedded systems development are at opposite ends of that spectrum. The Python language is the one notable exception to this rule. Learning new and alien skills for engineers from either end of this spectrum is challenging and time-consuming. Still, it is precisely this that is required to modernize the embedded systems software development lifecycle.

The two ends of the spectrum are now beginning to merge towards one another. The growing prevalence of IoT is a technology that is arguably the most significant catalyst for this change. Connected devices are bringing the cloud directly into the embedded systems domain and, with it, the working practices associated with the cloud.

With IoT, we can also see Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence entering the embedded systems domain. Machine Learning is nothing without data, and IoT is nothing but data. A symbiotic relationship is developing between these technologies, driving the evolution of intelligent factories and smart cities. Robotics and autonomous vehicles also provide an environment of rapid transformation and the convergence of technical domains.

Edge computing is the most apparent domain where embedded systems development and cloud technologies collide, with embedded systems acting as an extension of the cloud, providing compute resources and remote execution of containerized applications on the edge, embedded cloud.

This change has now arrived, and like all change, it is happening very slowly and then all at once. Elite engineering teams have successfully integrated their software development lifecycles, but widespread adoption is far behind these early adopters.

The contents of this repository aims to provide examples of how engineering teams can achieve this fusion between embedded systems engineering and cloud-native development practices. To quote William Gibson:

"The future is here - it's just not evenly distributed."

We want to help solve that.
