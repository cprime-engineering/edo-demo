## Embedded DevSecOps Demo

This repository contains examples of how engineering teams can apply cloud-native DevSecOps practices when developing embedded systems software.

Over the last twenty years, cloud computing has revolutionized how engineers approach software development. Cloud computing changed many paradigms and turned technical constraints upside down. Infrastructure became disposable, computing power available on demand and billable by the second. Software dependencies are now distributed ecosystems at a global scale.

In the last five years, mainstream engineering practices have matured to work cohesively within these new programming paradigms. Cloud-native development practices have crossed the chasm: they are the new normal, the state of the art.

Any engineering team not practicing continuous delivery and automated code quality validation can now be considered Luddite. Artificial Intelligence now plays a front-stage role in software development, code quality, and security demand AI's involvement. Contemporary software quality is now beyond human capacity.
