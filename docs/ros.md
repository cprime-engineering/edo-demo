# The Robot Operating System (ROS)

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a collection of open-source software used in the robotics industry to act as the operating system for robotic appliances. ROS also includes a suite of open-source tooling used in the robotics software development lifecycle.

The ROS ecosystem consists of three software platforms:

## ROS

A software development kit and collection of reusable libraries to build robot applications. These libraries include hardware drives, algorithms, and developer tools.

## Gazebo

A digital twin simulation environment capable of simulating robots and the environments in which those robots operate. Gazebo is used to simulate environments such as warehousing and autonomous driving and was recently used to simulate the lunar environment as part of the NASA VIPER program. Gazebo includes a physics engine, high-resolution 3D graphics, and programmatic interfaces with native integration to ROS.

## Open Robotics  Middleware Framework (Open-RMF)

Open-RMF is a software library that enables interoperability between robotic systems. Open-RMF can coordinate multiple fleets of robots with each other and integrate those robots with environmental systems. Open-RMF can coordinate communication between robotic fleets and connected systems such as doors, elevators, environmental sensors, and industrial equipment.
