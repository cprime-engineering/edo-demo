# Boston Dynamics Spot

Spot from Boston Dynamics is a semi-autonomous mobile robot capable of navigating various terrain in a broad range of environmental conditions. Ideally suited to inspection tasks in environments that are potentially hazardous to humans, Spot is an ideal robotic platform for preventative maintenance use cases.

An operator can control Spot with a hand-held control or remotely seeing through Spot's cameras in real-time. Robot commands include body posing, velocity, and direction. Alternatively, engineers can record maps and create missions with behavior trees by programming actions associated with specific points on the map. Spot can then use these maps to navigate planned routes autonomously.

End users can extend the Spot robotic platform through mechanical and electrical interfaces. Boston Dynamics also maintain a robust Python software development kit to program behaviors and integrate sensors and custom payloads. Data pipelines also allow the processing of data collected by Spot in real-time utilizing AI models.
