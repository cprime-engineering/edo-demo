# Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a managed service hosted in the Microsoft Azure cloud. IoT Hub acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between cloud-based IoT solutions and remote devices; these include any IoT device capable of communication via established protocols such as HTTPS, AMQP, and MQTT. These could be cameras, sensors or actuators, plains, trains, automobiles, or robots.

IoT Hub enables highly secure and reliable communication between cloud services and the devices they manage. Azure IoT Hub provides a cloud-hosted solution backend to connect IoT devices. IoT Hub allows the extension of solutions from the cloud to the edge with per-device authentication, built-in device management, and scaled provisioning.
