# Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a managed service hosted in the Microsoft Azure cloud. IoT Hub acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between cloud-based IoT solutions and remote devices; these include any IoT device capable of communication via established protocols such as HTTPS, AMQP, and MQTT. These could be cameras, sensors or actuators, plains, trains, automobiles, or robots.

IoT Hub enables highly secure and reliable communication between cloud services and the devices they manage. Azure IoT Hub provides a cloud-hosted solution backend to connect IoT devices. IoT Hub allows the extension of solutions from the cloud to the edge with per-device authentication, built-in device management, and scaled provisioning.

IoT Hub facilitates bi-directional communication in the cloud. Capable of authenticating, managing, and provisioning millions of devices reliably and securely, including device health monitoring.

We selected Azure IoT Hub for this demonstration solution for two main reasons.

The first is that BMW and Microsoft have already invested in a real-world solution within BMW's Industry 4.0 manufacturing facilities. The result is a fully operational, industrial-grade solution validated in a business-critical manufacturing environment.

As a result of that project, Microsoft and BMW captured some of their findings and established an open manufacturing platform. This platform has now become a Linux Foundation project. This initiative aims to share research and development across manufacturing organizations—contributors to the platform address mutual problems, which are considered non-differentiating. Results are shared based on an open-source model.

The issue we found with AWS is its history of competing with its own customers and using its monopoly position for leverage. An example is when AWS purchased Kiva Systems in 2012 and rebranded Kiva to Amazon Robotics shortly after AWS informed Kiva's previous customers that they could no longer buy new Kiva technology—providing AWS with a significant competitive advantage over those customers.

This project intends to result in a commercially viable offering for our clients; as Microsoft has no similar history, we consider this a risk mitigation for potential commercial engagements.

We discovered some secondary benefits in Azure IoT Hub Github repositories. Projects such as the Boston Dynamics Spot ROS Wrapper and the ROS IoT Hub wrapper show potential for development within this project and are potential accelerators for future feature development.
