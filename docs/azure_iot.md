# Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a managed service hosted in the Microsoft Azure cloud. IoT Hub acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between cloud-based IoT solutions and remote devices; these include any IoT device capable of communication via established protocols such as HTTPS, AMQP, and MQTT. These could be cameras, sensors or actuators, plains, trains, automobiles, or robots.
