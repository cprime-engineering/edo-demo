Feature: showing off behave

  Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique
  that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or
  business participants in a software project.

    Background: we want to show off behave
      Given We are working on a software project name "edo-dewmo"
      And we need to demonstrate python "behave"
      And that demonstration needs to wrap "c++" in python "behave"

    Scenario: run a simple test
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a test
      Then behave will test it for us!
